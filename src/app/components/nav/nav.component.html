  <div class="about__text blurb">
    Baristas often need to memorize a great deal of recipes.
    With multiple updates and additions of new drinks every year,
    it's no wonder that many could get confused with the proper
    way to make them.
    <br>
    <br>
    Baristabook was created to enable baristas of all levels
    to craft drinks with a consistent quality. They can browse
    drink info to refresh their memory or save difficult ones in
    a personalized list for further study.
