    Baristas often need to memorize a great deal of recipes. With multiple updates and
    additions of
    new drinks every year, it's no wonder that many could get confused with the proper way to make them.
    <br>
    <br>
    Baristabook was created to enable baristas of all levels to craft drinks with a consistent quality. They can
    browse
    drink recipes to refresh their memory or save difficult ones in a personalized list for further study.
