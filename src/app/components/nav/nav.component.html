    Baristas often need to memorize a great deal of recipes.
    With multiple updates and additions of new drinks every year,
    it's no wonder that many could get confused with the proper
    way to make them.
    <br>
    <br>
    Baristabook was created to enable baristas of all levels
    to craft drinks with a consistent quality. They can browse
    drink info to refresh their memory or save difficult ones in
    a personalized list for further study.
    <br>
    <br>
    This simple yet functional app was developed by a barista from
    the bustling strip of Las Vegas, NV in Q1 2020. And although she
    enjoys making drinks and asking-flexing on her cashiers, 'Is that all
    you've got?' when she runs out of said drinks... <small>(Only to be
      slammed dunked and be deceased thereafter...)</small> She intended
    for this app to be more than just a tool that could be used for
    work - but as a ticket to even greater heights.
