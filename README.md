# Baristabook

Created with [Node.js, Angular, Express, &amp; MongoDB]

Baristas often need to memorize a great deal of recipes. With multiple updates and additions of new drinks every year, it's no wonder that many could get confused with the proper way to make them.

Baristabook was created to enable baristas of all levels to craft drinks with a consistent quality. They can browse drink info to refresh their memory or save difficult ones in a personalized list for further study.
